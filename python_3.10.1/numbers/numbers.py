# In python the number are divided into :
# THREEE types and they are 
# int (integers) , float(all fractional values) ,complex (which are of real and imaginary numbers )
#
# ----> int  example : 1,2,3,4,5,66,67, ............
#-------> float examples :1.2,.35.0 ,0.09889  ,......
#-----------> complex examples: 2+i8 ,3+i9,6+L4 ,e, .......
# ALL THE OPERATORS ARE NORMAL IN THE PYTHON 
# 
#""""" HEERE WE ARE USING THE PRINT FUNCTION TO GET OUTPUT IN THE SOURCE CODE """"
# SYNTAX OF PRINT("") OR PRINT() {LOWERCASE CASE SENSITIVE}




#Any operation on number with ----->init  with   inti  is always init 

print ("welcome to the python programming ")

print( "Multipication of two numbers : ",10 * 122)
print( "Division  of two numbers : ",10 / 122)
print( "Reminder of two numbers : ",10 % 122)

#Any operation on number with ----->float  with   float is always float

# finally rarely complex number any operation complex numbers is always complex
